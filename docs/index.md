## What is Kubernetes? :ship:

> Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery.

_Source:_ [What is Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/)


## History:

**Kubernetes is known to be a descendant of Google's system BORG**

> The first unified container-management system developed at Google was the system we internally call Borg.
It was built to manage both long-running services and batch jobs, which had previously been handled by two separate
systems: Babysitter and the Global Work Queue. The latterâ€™s architecture strongly influenced Borg, but was focused on
batch jobs; both predated Linux control groups.

Kubernetes celebrates its birthday every year on 21st July. Kubernetes 1.0 was released on July 21 2015, after being first announced to the public at [Dockercon in June 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrxnVKZeqK8).
